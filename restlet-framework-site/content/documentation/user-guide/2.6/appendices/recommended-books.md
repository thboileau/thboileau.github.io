No list of recommended resources will be exhaustive but this list comprises a really good introduction to the books we think would help you through your discovery of the Restlet Framework.

# Restlet in action (Manning)

[ ![Restlet in action (Manning)](../images/restlet-in-action-120.png)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/193518234X/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=193518234X&linkCode=as2&tag=restlet-20)

Restlet in Action gets you started with the Restlet Framework
and the REST architecture style. You'll create and deploy applications
in record time while learning to use popular RESTful Web APIs
effectively. This book looks at the many faces of web development,
including server- and client-side, along with cloud computing, mobile
Android devices, and semantic web applications. It offers a particular
focus on Google's innovative Google Web Toolkit, Google App Engine,
and Android technologies.

The book takes you though a comprehensive presentation of
Restlet's main features, including subjects like security, testing and
automatic documentation. You'll learn while following the typical
Restlet development process, with consistent illustrations based on a
sample RESTful email app.


# RESTful Web Services (O'Reilly)

[ ![RESTful Web Services (O'Reilly)](../images/restful-web-services.png)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRestful-Web-Services-Leonard-Richardson%2Fdp%2F0596529260%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1173381194%26sr%3D8-1&amp;tag=restlet-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325)

In this milestone book, <a href="http://www.crummy.com/">Leonard
Richardson</a> and <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/">Sam
Ruby</a> guide you through a revealing journey inside the architecture of
the Web. Using concrete examples, they help you to use HTTP, URIs and
REST at their full potential.


A design process called Resource Oriented Architecture provides
a pragmatic application of REST principles and best practices based on
findings from the REST community. Importantly, this book is also the
first one to significantly cover the Restlet framework, providing a
good opportunity to compare it to other frameworks like Ruby on Rails
and django. A must read for all REST and Restlet enthousiasts!

# Java Concurrency in Practice (Addison-Wesley)

[ ![Java Concurrency in Practice (Addison-Wesley)](../images/java-concurrency-in-practice.png)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0321349601&tag=restlet-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)

RESTful Web applications are very scalable in nature and the
Restlet framework lets you fully take advantage of this REST
architectural feature throught multi-threading and a session-free
design. Still, you need to be aware of the Java concurrency best
practices when designing your Restlet applications.

This book was written by the team how designed the new
concurrency features added to Java 5 and Java 6. It has four parts:
Fundamentals, Structuring Concurrent Applications, Liveness,
Performance, and Testing, Advanced Topics.


# Effective Java, Second Edition (Addison-Wesley)

[ ![Effective Java, Second Edition (Addison-Wesley)](../images/effective-java.png)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201310058?ie=UTF8&tag=restlet-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0201310058)

While Restlet was designed to perfectly match the REST concepts,
great care was also taken when transposing those concepts into a clean
Java API. Among the various sources available on Java API design best
practices, this book comes out as a clear winner. Each one of the 78
rules proposed is clearly explained, with pros and cons put in a
balance and clarified with examples.

This book was written by Joshua Bloch, chief Java architect at
Google, and the new edition covers the latest enhancements to the Java
language such as Generics, Annotations or Enums. Every Restlet as well
as every Java programmer should have this gem on his bookshelf!


# Java and XML, Third Edition (O'Reilly)

[ ![Java and XML (O'Reilly)](../images/java-and-xml.png)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FJava-XML-Brett-McLaughlin%2Fdp%2F059610149X%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1178275118%26sr%3D8-1&tag=restlet-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)

If you are new to XML or to XML used in Java, this is a useful
hands on book to read. In its third edition published in December
2006, it now covers the most recent XML processing techniques such as
StaX.

As XML is the most common way to exchange representations in
RESTful applications, this is an essential piece of technology to
understand. This will definitely help you while learning REST and the
Restlet framework which has extensive support for XML.

# Programming for PaaS (O'Reilly)

[ ![Java and XML (O'Reilly)](../images/programming-for-paas.png)](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-PaaS-Lucas-Carlson/dp/1449334903)

Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) is gaining serious traction among web and mobile developers, but as new PaaS providers emerge and existing vendors upgrade their features, it’s hard to keep track of what PaaS has to offer. This thorough introduction takes you through the PaaS model from a developer’s point of view, and breaks down the types of services that Google App Engine, Windows Azure, Heroku, Cloud Foundry, and others deliver.

The book also recommends Restlet Framework to interact with RESTful web APIs from Android mobile apps. Restlet also provides APISpark, its own PaaS for Web APIs, so this book is a recommend read for all Restlet developers.
