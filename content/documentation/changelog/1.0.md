   Reported by Lee Saferite.
 - Fixed bug causing the Request.challengeResponse to be overriden after a setChallengeResponse() call
   before the first getChallengeResponse() call.
 - When a Client HTTP connector receives a non HTTP URI, it now correctly sets the response status

   in case they don't exist.
 - Fixed bug in the FileClientHelper. The renameTo method may fail (depending on the JVM)
   when renaming a file from a filesystem to another.
 - Fixed bug in the FileUpload extension. The RepresentationContext class does not return
   the full content-type (with parameter) expected by the underlying Apache Commons-fileupload's
   FileItem parser. Reported and contributed by Christian Ohr.
 - Fixed bug in ByteUtils.toString method, lack of a characterSet parameter in order
   to read the inner input stream correctly. Reported by ?zg?n Atacan.

   This usage is discouraged by an information message but now allowed. Suggested by
   Diggory Briercliffe.
 - Removed deprecated MediaType constant APPLICATION_RDF (Use APPLICATION_RDF_XML instead).

[Enhancements]

   Servlet and especially Spring. Inspired from discussions with Ryan Daum, Michael
   Makunas, Jim Alateras, Shlok and Jonathan Hall.
 - Updated Jetty to version 6.1.2 RC2.
 - Refactored internal NRE HTTP classes to provide more extension points.
 - FileRepresentation now relies on a FileInputStream to expose a readable channel
   as it requires a read-only access to the file.

   logic to test edge cases. Suggested by Justin C. van Vorst

1.0 RC6 (2007-03-21)

 - Added Parameter.setName() method.
 - Media type APPLICATION_RDF was renamed to APPLICATION_RDF_XML and TEXT_RDF_N3 was
   added. Suggested by Ryan Daum.
 - Changed secret type in classes ChallengeResponse and Guard classes from String to char[] according
   to a best practice followed by Sun about the way sensible data must be stored in Java programs.
   Suggested by Aron Roberts.

[Enhancements]
 - Fixed Spring plugin descriptor for Eclipse.
 - Upgraded Velocity to version 1.5.
 - Added Apache Commons Lang library, dependency for Velocity 1.5.

 - Fixed potential NPE in Router.detach() method. Reported by Alex Combs.
 - Stop the applications attached to the default virtual host when stopping the component. Reported by Alex Combs.
 - Fixed ServerServlet adapter to make it start and stop the application with the Servlet lifecycle. Previously the
   application was started upon the first request and never stopped.
 - Fixed bug with the order of the representations provided by a Directory (TEXT/URI-LIST and TEXT/HTML) as IE does
   not send HTML preference in the Accept headers.
 - Send the Vary header only to none-MSIE user agents as MSIE seems to support badly this header. Reported by Heinrich Klobuczek.
 - Enhanced but non completely fixed support of long URIs (due to regexp limitations). Reported by Ivan Gorgiev.

   It is currently based on JDK's internal XSLT engine. Suggested by Denis Haskin.
 - The default name of the application's context logger is now either the canonical application's class name,
   or "org.restlet.application" for anonymous classes. It allows for a finer filtering of log entries.
 - Added a SpringFinder class in the Spring extension to allow easier dependency injection
   with resources. Suggested by Jonathan Hall, Valdis Rigdon and Ryan Daum.

   Suggested by Sean Landis.
 - Fixed bug with repeated patterns in URI templates. Reported by Vincent Lari.
 - Fixed bugs in some POM files. Reported by Mitchell Stewart.
 - The query need to be reconstruct and appended to the requestURI in order to get the "full" uri
   from AsyncWeb request object. Reported by David Rauschenbach.
 - Fixed NPE in the URI template scoring method.

[API changes]
 - Added Resource.getPreferredRepresentation() method as a shortcut to
   getRepresentation(getPreferredVariant()).
 - Renamed org.restlet.util.Factory to Engine as it does more than just providing factory methods.
 - Added init(Context, Request, Response) method and default constructor to Resource.
 - Finder now looks for a default Resource constructor if the current one (with 3 args) couldn't be found.
   Suggested by Diggory Briercliffe, Brandon Lonac, Sean Landis and Ryan Daum.

1.0 RC3 (2007-01-19)
[Bugs fixed]
 - Fixed bug with the uri parsing in the DirectoryResource class. The query part of the resource uri
   is removed before sending request to the file connector.
 - The content negotiation was throwing class cast exceptions when a resource was
   returning simple Variant instance via getVariants().
 - Fixed potential NPE in HttpRequest due to autoboxing. Reported by Valdis Rigdon.
 - Fixed bug preventing the Jetty connector from returning error status representations.
 - Fixed bug in DomRepresentation when outputting an instance based on a XML representation.
 - Fixed bug in Jetty connector potentially trying to send a response twice. Reported by
   Diggory Briercliffe.
 - VirtualHost now always set the rootRef, even if the attached Restlet isn't an Application.
 - Fixed bug in HttpRequest constructor in case the path of the URI starts with "//". Reported by
   Vincent Lari.

[API changes]
 - Added ReferenceList.getWebRepresentation() method, using exsiting logic from Directory.
 - Deprecated Directory.getDirectoryVariants() method and added getIndexVariants() +
   getIndexRepresentation() method to follow recent refactoring in Resource.
 - ClientInfo.port and ServerInfo.port are now 'int' instead of 'Integer' to prevent autoboxing issues.
 - Added getStatus(Method, Variant) and hasSome() methods to Conditions. Logic moved from private Handler methods.
 - Added Guard.getSecret() method for easier customization of the authentication system.
 - Guard.reject() is now public to allow standalone usage, without filtering.
 - Moved Resource.identifier property to Variant class.
 - Variant and Representation don't derive from Resource anymore.
 - Replaced Handler & Resource couple by a more flexible Finder & Resource couple. Based
   on real implementation experience, it became clear that a Resource should have full
   access to the request and response object. As a side effect, the Finder class can now
   dynamically instantiate the target resources without needing a subclass. The Resource
   class now contains handle*() methods, with no parameters but with the same logic as
   the deprecated Handler.handle*(Resource,Request,Response) methods.
 - Added convenience attach() and attachDefault() methods on Router to add in a single call
   a Route to a Finder creating new instance of a given target Resource class.
 - Deprecated Result class not used anymore.
 - Deprecated WrapperResource class.
 - Added Context.attributes property as a way to share objects between all Restlets
   of an application. Automatically includes the parent application if any.
 - Added Filter.setNext() method taking a Resource class as parameter and automatically
   creating an associated Finder instance.
 - Added TransformRepresentation by refactoring private logic from Transformer.
 - Added Resource.generateRef() to dynamically format URI templates into proper references.
   Suggested by Yuri de Wit.
 - Added the "o" variable in the Template variable list for the new Request.rootRef property.
 - The creation of new Routes by a Router can now be customized via the protected createRoute() method.
 - Enhanced the Guard class to cleanly separate authentication from authorization logic.
   Thanks to Charles Gay (from jGuard) for the feed-back and related discussion.

[Enhancements]
 - The content negotiation algorithm is now more flexible about languages. It will try
   to satisfy the client languages preferences, but will always return a representation
   if the media type is accepted, even if the language is not explicitely accepted.
 - Upgraded Jetty to 6.1.1.
 - Added a dual licensing for GPL (with a Classpath exception) in addition to CDDL.
 - The ServerServlet now allows easier customization of the creation of Application
   instances. Based on a patch from Valdis Rigdon.

   that faciliates the evaluation of XPath expressions and manages a context namespaces.
 - Added Message.getEntityAsSax() and getEntityAsDom() methods.
 - Added org.restlet.util.NodeSet that facilitates the iteration over a DOM NodeList.
 - Split Representation class into a new Variant class (containing all metadata
   properties) and into a lighter Representation class. Variant is a subclass of
   Resource and Representation a subclass of Variant. Zero impact on existing code.
 - Changed getVariants() to return a List<Variant> instead of a List<Representation>.
   Suggested by Sumit Lohia.
 - Added getRepresentation(Variant variant) : Representation return the full representation
   for a variant. By default, it will return 'variant' in case it is already a
   representation (instance of Representation class). Suggested by Sumit Lohia.
 - Renamed Representation.getValue() into getText() to be more precise about intent.
 - Handler.handle() now set the response status to 404 (Not Found) only if the target
   resource is null *and* if the response status is a success. Reported by Chris Battey.
 - Added MediaType.equals(Object, boolean ignoreParameters) to allow comparison without
   taking into account the parameters (useful for multipart forms for example, because
   they have a varying "boundary" parameter. Reported by Randy Layman.
 - The character set of request entities is now parsed and set.
 - PreferenceReader class (used for entity metadata headers parsing) now attempts to reuse
   constants (MediaType, CharacterSet, etc.) when possible. Suggested by Randy Layman.
 - Renamed Dispatcher into Uniform to better match with REST terminology. No impact on existing code.
 - Deprecated Resource.getIdentifiers() and setIdentifiers() method. No obvious usage. More the role of Handler to map/select URIs.
 - Renamed "com.noelios.restlet.example" to "org.restlet.example" as no more direct dependency on NRE exists in code.
 - Added new constructor to Variable, taking only a variable type.
 - Added a Request.rootRef property storing the reference of the application root. This
   is be very important when generating URI that must be independent of the application's
   deployment context.
 - StringRepresentation constructors now accept CharSequence instances and not just String
   instances. This plays nicer with StringBuilder, CharBuffer and StringBuffer classes.
 - Template can now also parse and format using a map to hold variables. Suggested by Ryan Daum.

[Enhancements]
 - The Ant script now check Ant's version and recommend upgrade to at least 1.7 for
   better integration with JUnit. Suggested by Dave Pawson.

 - Added db4o 6.0 as a library. Used as an object database engine for some examples.

1.0 RC1 (2006-12-26)
[Bugs fixed]
 - Handler now sets the response entity from the Result instance returned for the DELETE,
   POST and PUT methods. Reported by Randy Layman.
 - If the status is SUCCESS_NO_CONTENT or SUCCESS_RESET_CONTENT, the response entity is
   not sent back to the client by HTTP server connectors.
 - Special characters in Template instance could conflict with special internal characters
   (Regex). They are now quoted properly.
 - The Simple HTTP connector returned in invalid server address.
 - When a Restlet is normally initialized, the current response doesn't reset its "status"
   property anymore.

[API changes]

   taking an instance of Reference. Following a remark from Alex Combs.
 - Deprecated the trace() method from Dispatcher.
 - Added an "identityCheck" property on LogService to turn on the IDENT identification
   (RFC 1413). This would allow the default log format to display it.
 - Refactored com.noelios.restlet.LogFilter to make the default format follow more stricly
   the W3C Extended Log File Format with most of the default fields of Microsoft IIS 6.0.
 - Deprecated Conditions.isModified() method. Logic moved to Handler.

 - Updated Jetty to version 6.1 RC2.
 - Added a com.noelios.restlet.util.DefaultAccessLogFormatter adding a log format header.
 - Removed unecessary logic from org.restlet.Client.

 - Added static valueOf() methods to ChallengeScheme, CharacterSet, Encoding, Language, MediaType, Method, Protocol and Status.
   Sometimes renamed existing create() method. Suggested by Piyush Purang.
 - Clarified the Javadocs of root classes in org.restlet.
 - Added a Message.setEntity(String, MediaType) method facilitating the setting of string-based entities.
 - Fully updated the FAQ.
 - Updated pictures in the tutorial to reflect the latest API changes (Application, hierarchy changes, etc.).
 - Form handling code don't throw IO exceptions anymore for Call.getInputAsForm() and Reference.getQueryAsForm(). Issue reported by Piyush Purang.
 - Added modification support (PUT and DELETE) to DirectoryHandler. Suggested by Don Dwoske and John D. Mitchell.
   Implementation contributed by Thierry Boileau.
 - Added "protocol" property on Call.
 - Added FTP constant to Protocol.
 - Improved detection of default ports in Reference.toString() static methods. Added new toString() variant.
 - HTTP client connectors now set the "Host" header manually when proper information is found via Call.getServer()."name" and "port".
 - Refactored the parsing/construction of the target resource reference to handle both relative and absolute URIs.
 - Improved robustness of Reference when handling relative URIs.
 - Added a "javadoc-hide" property to "build.properties" to hide the Javadocs of implementation packages (true by default).
 - Added shortcut attach/detach methods to Router, equivalent to getScorers().add()/removeAll().
 - Method Filter.getNext(Call) is now final to prevent overriding. If needed, use Chainer as base class.
 - Added ScorerList.removeAll(UniformInterface) method to remove all scorers pointing to a given handler.
 - Added Protocol.ALL constant as a protocol wildcard.
 - Added "hosts" and "localHost" properties to Container.
 - Updated tutorial examples to leverage application concept.
 - Refactored all usages of the JDK's loggers in order to reuse the Context's logger, allowing separation of messages for each application.
 - Optimized the ByteUtils.write(is, os) method.
 - Added a "defaultScorer" property on Router to have a way to catch calls when no scorer in the normal list matched.
 - Scorer is no longer abstract, score() now returns 1.0 by default.
 - Handler is no longer abstract, findTarget() now returns "null" by default.
 - Refactored HTTP call converters: introduce super HttpConverter class. Added pluggability of converters via a simple connector parameter. Following a request from Diggory Briercliffe.
 - Representation is no longer abstract and "transient" and "available" properties can be externally modified. Added empty constructor.
 - Added support "Allow" HTTP headers. New allow*() methods added on Resource and support for setting the 405 status in the Handler class.
   Also added Resource."allowedMethod" property. Suggested by AJ Barnes and Lars Heuer.
 - Added Response.setStatus(status, message) method variant.
 - Added unit test covering execution of  FreeMarker templates.

1.0 beta 18 (2006-08-19)
[Bugs fixed]
 - Status descriptions are now sent back to Jetty 6 for error statuses. Reported by AJ Barnes.
 - The DirectoryHandler was listing the directories twice to do the content negotiation, slowing down the process.
 - The content negotiation was not properly handling the situation where no language and media type preferences are defined. Reported by Thierry Boileau.
 - Fixed potential NPE in DefaultClient and RedirectTestCase when no connector found.
 - Fixed bug in NRE's factory which prevented the detection of HTTPS connectors. Now all HTTPS connectors work fully (Simple, Jetty5 and Jetty6).
 - Fixed bug in DirectoryHandler preventing the return of a directory listing if an index file name was set but not found. Reported by Thierry Boileau.
 - Added option to turn off content negotiation on DirectoryHandler which was causing some issues with online Javadocs. The content negotiation is now
   off by default. Reported by Tiago Silveira.
 - Fixed caching conflicts with content negotiation. Now ETags are properly considered. Reported by Chris Winters.
 - Fixed potential NPE in the DateUtils comparison methods. Reported by Chris Winters.
 - Reworked all equals() methods in the data package to accept Object as parameter.
 - Fixed bug in MediaType.includes() and added a JUnit test case for MediaType comparison. Report and patch by Chris Winters.
 - Fixed bug in fluent builders prevent the proper usage of routers in routing mode.

[API breaking changes]
 - Removed get/setTimeout() methods from the Client interface and related classes. Also, removed the configureSsl() method from the Server interface.
   We will now use connectors'parameters instead. Suggested by John D. Mitchell.
 - NRE's HttpClient (based on HttpUrlConnection) now used these parameters: "chunkLength", "followRedirects", "allowUserInteraction", "useCaches"
   "connectTimeout" and "readTimeout".
 - NRE's HttpClient no longers sets the JDK's system property "http.keepalive" to "false". This could conflict with other classes using HttpUrlConnection.
 - Jetty 5.1 connector now supports parameters: "minThreads", "maxThreads", "lowResourcePersistTimeMs", "maxIdleTimeMs" for the HTTP server and
   "keystorePath", "keystorePassword", "keyPassword" for the HTTPS one.
 - Simple 3.1 connector now supports parameters: "defaultThreads", "waitTimeMs" for the HTTP server and "keystorePath", "keystorePassword",
   "keyPassword" for the HTTPS one.
 - Moved Jetty5 to com.noelios.ext.jetty5 package so that Javadocs of both versions can be displayed.
 - The "X-Forwarded-For" header is not used anymore by default to get all client addresses, including intermediary proxies. However, there is now a
   standard way to enable this feature: by setting the "useForwardedForHeader" parameter to "true" for the HTTP server connector used. Be aware of the
   potential security effects of using this header if you don't control all the intermediary proxies as the header could be faked otherwise. This change
   was suggested by John D. Mitchell.
 - Removed unused org.restlet.connector.LocalClient connector.
 - Moved content of com.noelios.restlet.impl to com.noelios.restlet, com.noelios.restlet.connector and com.noelios.restlet.data
 - Renamed Call's "outputRef" property back to "redirectRef" as we now have Representation's "identifier" property to get the location of the call's output.
 - Factorized all Call's client data into ClientData class (was PreferenceData).
 - Factorized all Call's server data into a new ServerData class.
 - Renamed Call.contextRef into Call.baseRef and Call.relativePath into Call.relativePart. Added Call.getRelativeRef returning a real relative reference.
 - org.restlet.Call is now a class instead of an interface. Removed DefaultCall classes.
 - Removed "requestHeader" and "responseHeader" variables from CallModel. Not accessible anymore at this point from an uniform Call.
 - Renamed static Reference.toUri() method into Reference.toString() for consistency with existing Reference.toString() methods (non-static).
 - Renamed Call.setBestOutput() into Call.setOutput() and adjusted the Javadocs to explain behavior (set best output for the given resource).
 - Removed empty and unused interfaces Gateway, OriginServer, Proxy, UserAgent, Cache, Resolver, Tunnel, ControlData, Data. Suggested by Piyush Purang.
 - Refactored CharacterSet, CharacterSets and DefaultCharacterSet into a single CharacterSet class.
 - Refactored Encoding, Encodings and DefaultEncoding into a single Encoding class.
 - Refactored ChallengeScheme, ChallengeSchemes and DefaultChallengeScheme into a single ChallengeScheme class.
 - Refactored Language, Languages and DefaultLanguage into a single Language class.
 - Refactored MediaType, MediaTypes and DefaultMediaType into a single MediaType class.
 - Refactored Method, Methods and DefaultMethod into a single Method class.
 - Refactored Protocol, Protocols and DefaultProtocol into a single Protocol class.
 - Refactored Status, Statuses and DefaultStatus into a single Status class.
 - Fixed the remaining inconsistent usages of ParameterList. Removed MediaType.getParametersValue().
   Now getParameters() methods always instantiate a new list of none was existing before.
 - Separated HTTP constants (header names and status codes) into a separate HttpConstants class.
 - Added an org.restlet.component.Application class to hold a portable Restlet Application.
 - Added org.restlet.Context and a specialized ContainerContext subclass. This allow container to provide contextual services to Restlet, without giving
   a direct access to the container itself or to its connectors.
 - Following the advices of API design gurus Eamonn McManus and Joshua Bloch), I've refactored the whole API in several ways:
    - Set most of the member variables to "private" instead of "protected" for better encapsulation and evolving capabilities
    - Removed most interfaces which and too fragile and little useful without a default/abstract implementation.
 - Removed RestletServer and RestletContainer, replaced by Container and Application. A container manages a set of applications.
 - Separated the Handler concept into a Chainer (similar signature) and a Handler (new method specific to find the target resource). Handler now directly
   derives from Restlet. The goal is to provide a cleaner separation of roles.
 - The Resource interface doesn't derive anymore from Restlet. The responsability of the control and handling of incoming calls is moved to the repurposed
   Handler class.
 - Replaced ServerMap and ClientMap by ServerList and ClientList to fit with the new Container and Application classes.
 - Renamed DefaultClient and DefaultServer to GenericClient and GenericServer to better reflect the purpose of the classes and the concept of call
   dispatcher based on the scheme instead of the connector name.
 - Removed addition of custom headers from Call.connectorCall for JavaMailClient and HttpClient. Will now require the usage of Converters.
 - Fully refactored the context data of Call. Added a new org.restlet.data.ContextData class containing all data potentially varying with the current
   Restlet handling the call. For example Call.getResourcePath() is now Call.getContext().getRelativePath(), Call.setContextPath() is now Call.getContext().
   setBaseRef(), etc.
 - Replaced the CharacterSetPref, EncodingPref, LanguagePref and MediaTypePref by a generic Preference<Metadata> class.
 - Replaced Router.Mode enumeration by static constants on Router. Simplifies the Javadocs display and works well enough.
 - Moved org.restlet.Factory into a hidden org.restlet.spi.Factory package. Same thing for the NRE's Factory.
 - Replaced HostRouter.Mode enumeration by constants on HostRouter.
 - Moved WrapperMap to NRE util package as it's not used anymore in the API.
 - ScorerList now derives from WrapperList like similar classes (ClientList, ParameterList, etc.).
 - Renamed RedirectHandler to RedirectRestlet as it is not taking advantage of the features of a Handler.
 - Refactored the Servlet connector to make it work with the new notion of Restlet's context.
 - Added put() and delete() methods on Resource interface and related classes.
 - Renamed ContextClient into LocalClient to remove ambiguity with concept of Restlet's context.
 - Handler now has a default implementation of the handlePut() and handleDelete() methods.
 - Renamed ClientData.get*Prefs() methods into getAccepted*() to be more inline with HTTP terminology.
 - Refactored and improved robustness of the ServerServlet adapter. Now you have access to the ServletContext's logger and resources via the standard
   Restlet.getContext() methods.
 - Renamed HostRouter.ROUTING and FILTERING to USAGE_ROUTING and USAGE_FILTERING.
 - Renamed Router.mode to Router.routingMode.

[Other changes]
 - Separated the HTTP client connector (based on JDK's HttpUrlConnection) previously integrated to the NRE core. This will allow future alternative
   implementations like based on Apache HTTP Client or Apache MINA NIO framework. Please ensure that the new extension (com.noelios.restlet.ext.net) is
   added to your classpath when the application is making HTTP client calls.
 - Added ParameterList.getFirstValue() methods taking and additional "defaultValue" parameter.
 - Parameterized all connectors, including the LocalClient.
 - Added HTTPS connector for Jetty 6.0
 - Updated Jetty 6 to RC1.
 - The Jetty 6 extension now appears in the Javadocs due to the package renaming of the Jetty 5 extension.
 - Updated documentation, especially for the distribution. Suggested by Dave Pawson.
 - Added more control on Simple HTTPS connector, see list of parameters.
 - Updated AsyncWeb to version 0.8.2.
 - The number of worker threads can now be configured for AsyncWeb.
 - Refactored the names in the NRE's impl package, uses Abstract prefix for abstract classes and Default prefix for other ones implementing Restlet API.
 - The ServerServlet connector now copies all Servlet initialization parameters (from the Web Application then from the Web Container) into the connector
   parameters list. This allows the settings of the parameters related to HTTP server connectors in all cases (standalone or embedded).
 - ContextClient now uses parameters for its configuration (default encoding, language, mediatype, etc.).
 - Some unit test were catching exceptions, preventing JUnit from failing the tests.
 - Added a Resource.setIdentifier() method taking a URI as a String.
 - Now the "Content-Location" is supported, for both the HTTP client and server connectors. The corresponding property is available via the
   call.getOutput().get/setIdentifier() method.
 - Added a default implementation for the HEAD method in AbstractResource and AbstractHttpServer. Suggested by Thierry Boileau.
 - Now, all calls' resource references are automatically normalized to ensure a consistent handling. Reported by Thierry Boileau.
 - Added Eclipse code formatter and template styles used to SVN.
 - Added DirectoryHandlerBuilder to allow the setting of the contentNegotiation flag.
 - Added SVG media type constant to MediaTypes. Also part of the common extesions (*.svg) of ContextClient.
 - Improved the default directory listing template to look more like Apache style of listing. Added the ".." link when possible, etc.
 - Added Reference.getParentRef() method.
 - Added Tag.ALL constant, equivalent to the special "*" value in HTTP.

1.0 beta 17 (2006-07-19)
[Bugs fixed]
 - Fixed regression in Jetty 6.0 connector which prevented the handling of requests.
 - When building its pattern, the HostRouter now adds case insensitive flags for scheme names and domain names, strictly following the URI specification.
   Bug reported by Jim.
 - Fixed bugs in Reference.setHostName().
 - Fixed potential NPE in com.noelios.restlet.ext.fileupload.RepresentationContext. Reported by Mikkel Jensen.
 - Fixed potential NPE exceptions in the equals() methods of many metadata classes. Was causing a bug on http://www.noelios.com with English only browsers.
   Bug reported by Guillaume Laforge (Groovy).
 - For some unknown reason we were lower casing the type name in DefaultMediaType's constructor. This causes issues with FileUpload.
   Reported by Mikkel Jensen.
 - Fixed potential NPE in Reference.getTargetRef(). Reported by Thierry Boileau.
 - Fixed issue in ServletCall which was not setting the reason phrase for error statuses. Reported by Bill Morone.

[API breaking changes]
 - Renamed Filter.attach/detach to get/setTarget. Users won't assume that multiple targets can be attached, also the target can be looked up.
 - Removed nextHandle() method from Handler and AbstractHandler. Didn't bring much value.
 - Renamed RestletContainer.attach/detach into get/setRoot.
 - Renamed Router.getOptions() to getScorers() and changed the result type from List<Scorer> to ScorerList.
 - Removed Router.attach() methods and added equivalent add() methods to ScorerList.
 - Removed Router.detach() method. Use the getOptions().remove() methods instead.
 - Moved some routing logic from DefaultRouter to ScorerList, see new getFirst(), getLast(), getBest(), getNext() and getRandom() methods.
 - Renamed RouterMode.*_MATCH to RouterMode.* and ROUND_ROBIN to NEXT. Improved Javadocs.
 - Moved enumeration org.restlet.RouterMode into Router.Mode.
 - Refactorized usage of modifiable lists and map for more consistency. Suggested by Lars Heuer.
    - Added org.restlet.data.WrapperList and WrapperMap classes.
    - Added org.restlet.connector.ClientMap and ServerMap classes.
    - Moved Component.addClient() and addServer() methods to ClientMap.put() and ServerMap.put().
    - Updated tutorial examples to follow new syntax.
    - ParameterList now extends WrapperList to factorize wrapping logic.
    - RestletServer now uses a list of RestletContainer instead of a map. Removed unecessary add() methods.

[Other changes]
 - Fully reorganized the SVN code base to separate the packages and third-party into a set of Eclipse plugin projects with inter-dependencies.
 - Improved the packaging in the distribution so that each module/extension JAR is also an Eclipse plugin. Third-party libraries are also available
   as plugins directories. All the content of the "lib/" directory can be dropped in an Eclipse "plugins/" directory for direct usage in the IDE.
 - Added a "dependency.txt" file to list the main dependencies between the various plugins (external libraries and internal modules).
 - Added new RoadMap document at http://www.restlet.org/roadmap
 - Added new FAQ entry on "What are the underlying concepts?" and reorganized the questions a little.
 - Updated FreeMarker to version 2.3.8.
 - Updated Simple framework to version 3.1.3.
 - Updated Jetty 6 to version 6.0.0 RC0.
 - Updated JUnit to version 4.1.
 - Updated JavaMail to version 1.4.
 - Updated SLF4J to version 1.0.2.
 - Ensured that Reference normalization, scheme name setting and host name setting use lower case according to URI specification.
 - Added Preference.toString() implementation based on patch submitted by Chris Winters.
 - Added org.restlet.data.ScorerList implementing List<Scorer>.
 - Changed Preference.parameters type from List<Parameter> to ParameterList and adjusted related classes.
 - Added DefaultRouter.customFind() method as an easy hook for the RouteMode.CUSTOM routing mode.
 - Factorized the handling of IO exception in various HTTP server connectors into the base com.noelios.restlet.impl.HttpServer class.
   Now, when an IO exception, a one line log entry is added at the WARNING level, and the full stack trace is added at the INFO level.
   This is important to prevent excessive log entries for the Simple connector when the connection is closed by the client (Broken Pipe).
 - Improved the logging of PatternScorer's logic. Adjust your logging properties to see the traces (FINE and FINER levels).
 - Added log traces in CallImpl when a contextPath/Ref is specified before any resourcePath/Ref was specified. Reported by Thierry Boileau.

1.0 beta 16 (2006-06-30)
 - Renamed attachPath() to attachRouter() in RouterBuilder.
 - Updated all tutorial code snippets (some were slightly outdated)
 - Removed dependency of API on NRE in ReferenceList and RestletContainer.
 - Fixed bug in TunnelFilter (see issue 68). Reported by A.J. Barnes.
 - Restructured code source to split the "source/main" directory into "source/api" and "source/core".
 - Split NRE Javadocs into NRE Core Javadocs and NRE Extensions Javadocs.

1.0 beta 15 (2006-06-26)
 - Updated Jetty 6 to version beta 17.
 - Updated Apache FileUpload extension to version 1.1.1.
 - Fixed encoding name in JdbcClient sample XML document. Reported by Thierry Boileau.
 - Added new FileRepresentation constructor accepting a File instance.
 - Improved ByteUtils.write() methods for streams by automatically buffering output streams if necessary.
 - Removed the unecessary buffering of the input stream in ByteUtils.write(). We don't use the mark and set features.
 - Fixed AbstractRestlet which was not reporting the proper error when non standard Method instances were called but not handled.
 - Added CONTEXT and FILE protocols to Protocols enumeration.
 - Added com.noelios.restlet.data.FileReference.
 - Added org.restlet.data.ReferenceList to handle list of references, supporting the "text/uri-list" representations.
 - Renamed com.noelios.restlet.impl.HttpServerCallImpl to HttpServerCall.
 - Renamed "initParameters" into "properties" for Component interface and related classes.
 - Refactored the methods allowing the attachment of connectors in Component interface and related classes.
 - Removed "name" property from Connector and Component interfaces and related classes.
 - Added modifiable "properties" map to the Connector interface.
 - Added ContextClient implementing a client connector for the CONTEXT and FILE protocols, allowing REST access to contextual resources.
 - Moved StringUtils.normalizePath() method to FileReference.
 - Added JarReference supporting the JAR URIs defined by JDK's JarUrlConnection.
 - Added ContextReference supporting the custom context URIs. Those URIs allow the loading of representation from various contextual locations
   like the current class's classloader, the system's classloader, the Web application's context and the current thread's classloader.
 - Component.callClient(name, call) now recursively tries to find the closest match for the connector name by navigating in the hierarchy
   of owner components.
 - Fixed bug in ServerServlet in order to auto-start the target Restlet. Problem identified by Bill Morone.
 - Added ServletContextClient to server as a specialized ContextClient when the ServerServlet server connector is used.
 - Added log traces with the Router/PatternScorer logic with info on URI matching and context updating.
   Enable the log level FINE and FINER to see them in your log file. See JDK's logging mechanism for details. Reported by Bill Morone.
 - Added HttpUrlConnectionCall, subclass of the (now) generic HttpClientCall, that is based on JDK's HttpUrlConnection.
 - Changed the default value inserted by the RedirectRestlet when a URI variable is not found: was "null" and now is an empty string.
 - Changed the repeating variable delimiter in CallModel from "[" and "]" to "(" and ")" to prevent conflicts with the default instruction delimiter
   characters in StringTemplate. Reported by John D. Mitchell.
 - Added the possibility to add a local test for variable insertions: ${variableName?exists} in order to test the existence of the variable first.
   This is equivalent to #[if variableName]${variableName}#[end] but obviously shorter. Without this local test, the default model value will be inserted
   which may be "null" or some unfriendly string. Added related unit tests.
 - Added HTTP server connector based on AsyncWeb 0.8 which is based on Apache Mina 0.8. Contributed by Lars Heuer. Suggested by John D. Mitchell.
 - Removed ClientCall interface and refactored the Client interface and related classes that were too HTTP oriented.
 - Removed the ServerCall interface and moved the contract/logic into a new com.noelios.restlet.impl.HttpServer. It was to HTTP oriented.
   Refactored all Server related classes to adjust to the change. Provided a useful static handle(HttpServerCall, Restlet) method for classes that
   can't subclass HttpServer directly (Jetty 6 server and Servlet server).
 - Rewrote the tutorial part 11 (Routers and hierarchical URIs) to follow the best practice of not subclassing DefaultRouter. This is also more consistent
   with the part 12 using the fluent builders. Suggested by Bill Morone.
 - Removed the FileRestlet which doesn't bring significant lot of value now that we have a flexible DirectoryRestlet and ContextResource.
 - Renamed FileResource into ContextResource because it can now expose representation with all context authorities (file, class loaders, webapp context).
 - Refactored all connector to be stricter with the concept of supported protocol: it now means that the connector instance simultaneously supports all
   the protocols at the same time. When serveral protocols could be supported by a connector but in separate instances, a refactoring was done to create
   a subclass for each protocol.
 - The convention saying that each connector must provide a static getProtocols() method was replaced by a non-static getProtocols() method returning
   the list of protocol that can be simultaneously supported by the same instance.
 - For simplication purpose, the ServerServlet doesn't implements the Server interface anymore. It's still a pseudo-connector.
 - ComponentBuilder.setParameter() method was changed to addParameter() allowing repeating parameters.
 - Components and Connectors now have a getParameters() method that exposes a modifiable list of parameters (ParameterList instance).
 - Moved ContextResource to "impl" package
 - Added "readOnly" property to DirectoryRestlet to enable modifications from the client. By default, "readOnly" is set to true. Suggested by
   Don Dwoske and John D. Mitchell.
 - Refactored Resource interface to extend both Data and Restlet interfaces and moved it to the org.restlet.data package according to the REST classification.
 - Renamed Resource.getVariantsMetadata() to getVariants() for simplification purpose.
 - Added "identifier" and "identifiers" properties to the Resource interface (Reference instances), for the official and alias URIs.
 - Renamed "Chainlet" to "Filter" for all related classes, method names, references, etc.
 - Detailled the Filter interface with three methods: beforeHandle(), doHandle() and afterHandle() to facilitate
   creation of concrete filters for pre- and post-filtering.
 - Removed all templatization of Restlet related classes which caused too many warning now that both Resource and
   Representation are also implementing the Restlet interface and deriving from AbstractRestlet.
 - Added org.restlet.Scorer, org.restlet.AbstractScorer and com.noelios.restlet.impl.PatternScorer to formalize
   the attachment of Restlets to Routers.
 - Renamed "refirectionRef" to "outputRef" in Call, as this can be used for more than just redirection (cf HTTP)
 - Removed all attach() method that were accepting a Restlet class instead of a simple instance. The introduction
   of Handlers reduces the need for them and they seemed to confuse people. Impact of Router, Filter and Restlet
   Container interfaces and related classes (builders, etc.).
 - Merged RepresentationMetadata with the parent Representation and introduced a cleaner contract for getting the
   metadata information without loading in memory the actual representation's content. In particular, the
   "contentTransient" and "contentAvailable" properties were added to Representation and supported all over the place.
 - Added or improved the wrapper classes: WrapperRestlet, WrapperResource, WrapperRepresentation.
 - Improved the Router (ex-Maplet) interface, adding the "mode" (see RouterMode enum), "requiredScore" to consider
   a routing option as a match, "maxAttempts" for dynamic routing, "retryDelay" between two attempts. Exposed a
   modifiable list of routing options (Scorer).
 - Added the Handler interface and related classes as a parent interface for Router, Scorer and Filter interfaces.
 - Added RouterMode enumeration containing available routing modes (round robin, first match, last match, best
   match, random and custom). Those modes (except "custom") are directly supported by the DefaultRouter.
 - Reviewed and improved all the NRE representation to better support character encodings (StringRepresentation),
   serializable objects (ObjectRepresentation). Moved common logic to ByteUtils.
 - Renamed DirectoryRestlet into DirectoryHandler. No impact for those using the fluent builders.
 - A default ContextClient is automatically added to each RestletContainer created.
 - Removed the "contextMatches" property from Call interface and related classes. This was not that much useful nor working as expected.

1.0 beta 14 (2006-06-02)
 - Adjusted build.properties so that default values work directly.
 - Refactored the usage of parameter lists by using a new ParameterList (implementing List<Parameter>) and adding helper methods.
 - Form now derives from ParameterList.
 - ConnectorCall.getRequestHeaders() and getResponseHeaders() now return a ParameterList, other helper methods removed.
 - Added urlEncode() on Parameter.
 - Reference now sets new scheme names in lower case to respect normalization rules.
 - Added more unit tests for the Resltet API; Contributed by Lars Heuer.
 - Fixed bug in Jetty 5 HTTPS connector preventing the usage of the specified SSL keystore in certain cases. Found by Dave Pawson.
 - Added constructors to DefaultServer using the protocol's default port

1.0 beta 13 (2006-05-29)
 - Updated StringTemplate and StringTemplateRepresentation to allow the usage of different delimiters for variable insertion and instructions
   like conditions. The goal is to prevent conflict between variable names and (future) instruction names.
   Now the delimiters must be different and default to ${variableName} and #[if test1]...#[else if test2]...#[else]...#[end].
   WARNING: this has a potential impact on existing application using the old delimiters for instructions such as for the
   RedirectResltet target URI pattern.
 - Added support for single quotes to delimit the variable names in CallModel instances. Prevents the needs for double quote escaping in Java strings.
 - Enhanced the Reference to strictly conform to the URI RFC 3896. New methods, normalization code, resolution of relative URIs and relativization.
 - GuardChainlet doesn't log the password anymore. Reported by AJ Barnes.
 - Call.setRedirectionRef() and setResourceRef() now accept relative URIs (like ".."). The base URi is the current context. Suggested by Yuri de Wit.
 - Fixed bug in SimpleCall forgetting to add the port number in the request URIs.
 - Optimized response time of the Simple HTTP server connector. Suggested by Niall Gallagher.
 - Added DefaultBuilder.upMaplet() and upMaplet(level) to go up to parent Maplet builders without the need to count non Maplet builders
   and having to cast.
 - Added new RestletContainerBuilder constructor taking an existing RestletContainer instance.
 - Added empty RestletContainer constructor in case the name is never used.
 - Added HostMapletBuilder to facilitate the fluent configuration of Host Maplets.
 - Fully refactored the Ant build process using macro tasks.
 - Added support for Retroweaver in the build process to backport the classes to older JDKs than 5.0. Contributed by Lars Heuer.
 - Added a build.properties file containing the machine specific directories in order to have a universal build.xml Ant file. Suggested by Lars Heuer.
 - Added new attachHost(domain) method to ChainletBuilder, MapletBuilder and RestletContainerBuilder (refactored other attachHost() methods too).
 - Added "redirectStatus" property to HostMaplet.
 - Added a DOAP description for the Restlet project: http://www.restlet.org/docs/doap
 - Added RDF (APPLICATION_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTION_FRAMEWORK) to org.restlet.data.MediaTypes.
 - Added MapModel.remove() method.
 - Added DirectoryRestlet.addCommonExtensions() method to add common language and media type mappings to file extensions.
 - Added new parameter to DirectoryRestlet constructor to add common extensions.
 - Simplified tutorial examples based on the new addCommonExtensions() method.
 - Fixed bug in HostMaplet causing NPE when redirection to preferred URI was enabled.
 - Greatly simplified the sample application (http://www.restlet.org/sample) by using fluent builders.
 - Added createHost() and attachParent() methods to MapletBuilder and RestletContainerBuilder to delay the attachment (dynamic URI pattern) to the
   parent Maplet after the complete configuration.
 - Renamed DefaultBuilder into ObjectBuilder.
 - Added BuilderFactory and Builders classes to facilitate the instantiation of builders and their eventual subclassing by applications.
 - Added Reference.equals(Object) and Reference.hashCode() methods. Contributed by Lars Heuer.
 - Fixed bug with Call.getClientAddress() not being consistent with Call.getClientAddresses(). Reported by Lars Heuer.
 - Removed unecessary Call.setClientAddresses(List) method. Use the modifiable list returned by Call.getClientAddresses() instead.
 - Removed "parseDate" and "formatDate" from HttpServerCallImpl which are already in super class. Reported and fixed by Lars Heuer.
 - Added Reference.getProtocol() and setProtocol() method to manipulate the URI scheme component via the Protocol interface.
 - Added Protocols.create(schemeName) static method to allow reuse of Protocols enums.

1.0 beta 12 (2006-05-20)
 - Added com.noelios.restlet.build package containing builder classes allowing a compact construction of Restlet applications base of the Fluent design
   pattern coined by Martin Fowler. Based on suggestion and contribution from Lars Heuer and Yuri de Wit.
 - Added Tutorial 12 illustrating the used of builders to reimplement Tutorial 11.
 - Added buffering to Simple server to solve the performance issue.
 - Removed the Element interface which doesn't bring value to the framework.
 - Renamed "parent" property in Restlet into "owner" to prevent risk of confusion with the tree of Maplets or the tree of builders.
   Here the owner means the first component ownign or containing the Restlet handler, often a Restlet Container component.
 - Templatized the AbstractRestlet class with a subclass of Call. This way the handle(Get|Put|...) methods directly cast the call to the application's
   specialized Call. This is useful when the application has to enrich the default call using the WrapperCall class as it prevents frequent casts
   and other workarounds such as using a base class. Suggested by Lars Heuer.
 - Renamed CompressChainlet.ALWAYS_ENCODE constant into ENCODE_ALL_SIZES.
 - Added default implementation of GuardChainlet.authorize(Call) method based on a map of login, password couples.
 - When no encoding preferences were provided, we were assuming that all encodings were supported. Now we only assume that the identity encoding is
   supported. Reported by Lars Heuer.
 - Added new constructor to RedirectRestlet for the connector mode where you just have to give the connector name.
 - Added a "context" property to the ServletCall class for application needing access to it via the Call.getConnectorCall() approach.
 - Added empty constructor to AbstractChainlet.

1.0 beta 11 (2006-05-16)

 - Added EncoderRepresentation allowing the transparent encoding of a wrapped representation (supports GZip, Zip and Deflate).
 - Added DecoderRepresentation allowing the transparent decoding of a wrapped representation (supports GZip, Zip and Deflate).
 - Added an ExtractChainlet to extract some attributes from a call (query string parameters, input form parameters, call's template model
   or context matches). The extracted attributes are available via the Call.getAttributes() map. Suggested by Yuri de Wit.
 - Added TunnelChainlet, subclass of ExtractChainlet that can tunnel method name, accept headers and resource URI for clients unable to make full REST
   calls (like browsers restricted to GET and POST methods). Suggested by Yuri de Wit.
 - Added a forward(Call) method to AbstractRestlet to facilitate the internal forwarding and dispatching of calls (similar to Servlet forwarding).
   Suggested by John D. Mitchell.
 - Fixed issue with HTTP client connector when getting the response stream in error cases (404 not found, etc.).
 - The HTTP client connector nows correctly reads the "contentLength" headers and use the value to set the "size" property of the call output object.
 - Fixed bug in Statuses using an invalid code for CONNECTOR_* statuses.
 - Added an "attributes" map to the Call interface that can be used by developers to store information relative to the current call.
 - Added a return parameter to the Maplet.attach() methods to facilitate multiple attachments in a single call. Suggested by Yuri de Wit.
 - Removed getMethods() from the Resource interface as this is the responsability of Restlet handlers.
 - Added "multipart/form" media type to MediaTypes.
 - Do not add anymore the "acceptCharset/Encoding/Language" headers with "*" values if call has no preference defined. Reported by Dave Pawson.
 - Added a finer trace for file not found exceptions caught in Http Client connector. Reported by Dave Pawson.
 - Changed HTTP client to set the JDK's "keep alive" feature to false.
 - Fixed HTTP client bug preventing the reading of the output if no content type was returned. Reported by Dave Pawson.

 - Added detachAll() method to the Maplet interface.
 - Fixed bug preventing the DefaultServer from intercepting the handle(ServerCall) calls. Reported by Lars Heuer.
 - Added new attach() methods to Maplet taking an additional "override" parameter to make attachments with a higher priority than existing ones.
   Suggested by Roger Wallace.
 - Factorized some HTTP header parsing into Methods.create() and PreferenceUtils
 - Added support for getting of connector call request/response headers from the CallModel (call's template model).
   Useful for the TunnelChainlet to extract "X-HTTP-Method-Override" headers for example.
 - Added HEADER_X_HTTP_METHOD_OVERRIDE to ConnectorCall. This is specified by Google Data APIs.
 - Updated Jetty 6 to beta 16 version.
 - Renamed FreeMarkerRepresentation.getValues() to getDataModel() for consistency with the setDataModel() method. Reported by Lars Heuer.

1.0 beta 10 (2006-05-02)
 - Fully refactored the org.restlet.data package to reduce usage of interfaces and remove the need to use the Manager static methods
   whose implementation would not significantly vary from one implementation to another. When interfaces were needed, like for enumerations,
   the implementation class is provided with the Default* name. Inspired by a discussion with Henry Story.
 - Merged Manager class and Factory interface into a single Factory class.
 - Renamed RestletCall interface into Call for further simplification (was UniformCall in beta 8).
 - Renamed Call.getRestlet*() methods to getContext*().

 - Added a HostMaplet to provide an easy and flexible way to detect the URI related to a single host such as equivalent IP-based URIs.
   All aspects are configurable and there is choice between two attachment modes (parent Chainlet or Maplet).
   Suggested by Dave Pawson and John D. Mitchell.
 - The RestletContainer now also implements the Chainlet interface, in addition to the Maplet interface.
   If you use both attachment mechanisms at the same time, the Chainlet will have a higher priority.
   This is a convenient way to chain a Restlet as a root handler with having to specify a URI pattern (ex: logging, HostMaplet attachment).
 - Added org.restlet.connector.DefaultClient and DefaultServer to replace calls to Manager.createClient() and createServer().
 - Renamed RestletCallWrapper into WrapperCall for consistency purpose.
 - Renamed UniformCallModel into CallModel for consistency with Call interface naming.

 - Fixed issue with HTTP client connector not correctly reporting connection and other IO errors. Reported by Dave Pawson.
   This uses the new statuses:CONNECTOR_ERROR_CONNECTION, CONNECTOR_ERROR_COMMUNICATION and CONNECTOR_ERROR_INTERNAL.
 - Added "timeout" property to the Client connector interface. Default and infinite timeouts can be specified. Suggested by Dave Pawson.
 - Renamed "httpCode" property to "code" for the Status interface.
 - The content length of posted/put representations is now available when received by the HTTP connectors (based on Content-Length header availability).
 - Changed the Component "initParameters" property type to Map<String, String> instead of List<Parameter> for easier parameter value retrieval.
 - Allowed multiple protocol providers to be specified in a single meta-inf/services/org.restlet.connector.Client or Server file.
 - Added Protocol.equals(), getSchemeName() and getDefaultPort() methods.
 - Added hasTarget() method on Chainlet to indicate if a target was already attached.

 - The parent of all Restlets is now a simple Component and not necessarily a RestletContainer.
 - Factory and Manager were refactored for clarification and simplification purpose.
 - Added getInitParameters() to Component to allow external code to pass init params in a standard way (for example a main method or the ServerServlet).
 - Added a mechanism to pass the Servlet context path to the target component in the ServerServlet. Suggested by Yuri de Wit.
 - Significantly improved the ServerServlet Javadocs. Now it also includes a sample XML configuration.

 - Updated tutorial and sample application to match the latest API changes.

1.0 beta 8 (2006-04-10)
 - Fully decoupled the connectors from the Restlet implementation. NRE now autodiscovers the connectors on your classpath
   (order matters when multiple connectors are supporting the same protocol). As a consequence, you no longer need the
   Jetty and JavaMail classes on your classpath if you don't need them because the NRE factory doesn't contain anymore
   hardcoded reference to concrete connector classes.
 - Added DomRepresentation to NRE data package, a representation based on a DOM document

 - Added a better toString() implementation for Status instances (suggested by Jerome Bernard)
 - HTTP client connector was not setting the "content-length" header when sending an input representation (reported by Jerome Bernard)
 - Fixed Java Service Wrapper default configuration (library paths broken and no default main class). No it starts the third
   tutorial example. Thanks to Daniel Einspanjer for reporting the bug and suggesting the default service.
 - Refactored GuardChainlet to separate the concepts of authentication and authorization and make each step optional. More hooks
   provided to implement custom authentication schemes based on cookies, query params or IP addresses for example. Suggested by A.J. Barnes.
 - Added "login", "password" and "role" properties to the SecurityData interface. Used by the GuardChainlet if authentication succeeds.
   Can also be modified and accessed by the application to manage user roles and resource level access authorizations.

 - Tutorial source code has been added (com.noelios.restlet.tutorial)
 - Added normalizePath to StringUtils issues with file separators different between Unix and Windows
 - OriginServerImpl renamed ComponentImpl to follow the interfaces changes in 0.13beta
 - Fixed issue in getPath(index, strip) method of RestletCallImpl not passing on the index parameter (0 instead)

0.13 beta (2005-12-03)
 - Added a detailled tutorial (draft version)
 - Added doPut and doDelete methods to NRE HTTP client
 - Added MediaTypes.TEXT_PLAIN
 - Added code of tutorial examples in the com.noelios.restlet.test package
 - Implemented the getLastModificationDate() for FileRepresentation
 - Correctly sets the media type parameter passed to FileRepresentation
 - JettyConnection now sets the charset parameter for content-type headers, when a character set is defined
 - JettyConnection now sets the ETag header when a tag is defined
 - JettyConnection now sets the Expires header when an expiration date is defined
 - JettyConnection now sets the Last-Modified header when a modification date is defined
 - Added getMethods() method to org.restlet.Resource and FileResource, to return allowed methods
 - Added setResource() and getResource() to the Representation interface and AbstractRepresentation class
 - Moved connector handling methods from OriginServer to Component as other components (proxies, user agents,
   etc.) can have connectors attached to them

0.12 beta (2005-12-01)
 - Distribution license changed from GPL to CDDL (similar to Mozilla Public License).
 - Added createCharacterSet() to Factory interface, Manager and Engine classes.
 - HttpClient now correctly sets the output media type and character set when available.

0.11 beta (2005-11-29)
 - Renamed JettyConnector to JettyServer
 - Removed unnecessary HttpServer interface
 - Replaced many RestletException by IOException in non Restlet specific classes and interfaces
 - TemplateRepresentation no longer load the template upon creation as recommanded for performance reasons
 - Completed the separation between the Resltet API and the implementations: added org.restlet.Factory interface
   and org.restlet.Manager class.
 - Restlet API implementations must register their implementation of org.restlet.Factory with the
   org.restlet.Manager before usage.
 - Renamed CallImpl to UniformCallImpl
 - Added setter methods to UniformCall for request field (useful when preparing a call for a client connector)
 - Added org.restlet.component.DefaultRestletServer and DefaultRestletContainer for easy subclassing by
   developpers
 - Added client HTTP connector in NRE

0.10 beta (2005-11-17)
 - Renamed all Default* classes in com.noelios.restlet into *Impl for clarity purpose.
 - Added Status.getUri() method and improved Status.getDescription().
 - Removed the NONE values from Status and Method enumerations, null is doing a better job.
 - Added a DirectoryRestlet that behaves like a regular Web server. In addition, automatic media type, language
   and character set detection and setting is available in a way that hides technical names and extensions,
   allowing a clean content negotiation.
 - Fixed issue with character encoding in the TemplateRepresentation (FreeMarker integration).
 - Moved FileResource and FileRestlet to com.noelios.restlet
 - Refactored the Jetty HTTP server connector to bypass their HTTP handler layer. Now we directly work out of the
   Jetty SocketListener and HttpConnection class. This will improve performances and reduce the memory consumed.
   Note that version 5.1.5 of Jetty is required as it contains a necessary fix.
 - Moved classes in com.noelios.restlet.ext.jse into com.noelios.restlet (restlets, FileResource),
   com.noelios.restlet.data (representations and readers) or com.noelios.restlet.ext.jee (JDBC).
 - Refactored com.noelios.restelt.RestletMappings into com.noelios.MapletImpl and used it as a delegate in
   org.restlet.DefaultMaplet.
 - Added factory methods to the OriginServer and RestletContainer interface to let the developer override some
   default implementations and to prevent direct references to specific restlet API implementations.
 - Added proper getName() and getDescription() implementations to Method enums
 - Separated Method into Method, Methods and DefaultMethod to allow any method. Added getUri() method.
 - Separated CharacterSet into CharacterSet and CharacterSets.
 - Separated Language into Language and Languages.
 - Added all HTTP and WebDAV methods in Methods.
 - Separated Status into Status, Statuses and Default Status to allow any status.
 - Variant interface was renamed RepresentationMetadata to remove ambiguity. Also added "expirationDate",
   "modificationDate" and "tag" properties.
 - Added Tag interface and TagImpl for cache validation purpose.
 - Instead of deriving Variant, Representation now has a getMetadata() method returning an instance of
   RepresentationMetadata.
 - Added all existing HTTP and WebDAV statuses in Statuses.
 - Added a setTemporaryRedirect() method to UniformCall.
 - Upgraded the JDBC Client to support multiple databases, drivers and connection pools.

0.9 beta (2005-11-01)
 - Moved com.restlet into com.noelios.restlet
 - Moved  net.restlet into org.restlet
 - Added a readParameter(String parameterName) method to Form and FormReader and their default implementations
 - Allowed multiple invocations of the DefaultForm.getFormReader() method when it is possible to reset the
   underlying input stream.
 - Added a logging in com.noelios.restlet.ext.jetty.RestletHandler using java.util.logging mechanism.
 - Refactored all code to use J2SE 5.0 language features (generics, enums)
 - Added Status and Method enumerations in org.restlet.data
 - Renamed Call to UniformCall
 - Added a RestletCall interface which extends UniformCall with a flexible way to get the path of each restlet
   in the stack of restlets that handled the call so far.
 - Added a org.restlet.data.Reference interface to work around the limitation of java.net.URI which is not a
   mutable class.
 - Moved Resource and Restlet interfaces at the root level (org.restlet).
 - Refactored the UniformInterface. Many methods where moved to the Reference interface. Added "referrerURI" and
   "resourceURI" properties.
 - Separated the Restlet interface into Maplet and Restlet. Maplets are specialized restlets capable of
   delegating restlet calls to child restlets.
 - RestletContainer now extends Maplet.
 - Renamed DefaultRestlet into AbstractRestlet.
