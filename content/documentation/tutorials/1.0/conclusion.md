We have already covered many aspects of the framework. Before you move
on by yourself, let's take a step back and look at two hierarchy
diagrams showing the main concepts covered in this tutorial and their
relationships:

Now, here is the hierarchy with the core Representation classes:

Beside this tutorial, your best source of information will be the
Javadocs available for the [Restlet API](api/), the [Restlet
Extensions](ext/) and the [NRE](nre/). Have also a look at the
[connectors](connectors) section that lists all available client and
server connectors and explain how to use and configure them, and the
[integrations](integrations) section for a list of all available
extensions providing pluggable features such as integration with servlet
containers, generation of dynamic representations, etc. You can also
post your questions and help others in our [discussion
list](https://groups.google.com/a/restlet.org/forum/#!forum/framework-discuss).
