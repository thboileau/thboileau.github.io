We have already covered many aspects of the framework. Before you move
on by yourself, let's take a step back and look at two hierarchy
diagrams showing the main concepts covered in this tutorial and their
relationships:

Now, here is the hierarchy with the core Representation classes:

Beside this tutorial, your best source of information will be the
Javadocs of:
- the [Restlet API and Restlet Engine](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.restlet/org.restlet/{{% param version %}}/index.html)
- the [Restlet Extensions](/documentation/javadocs/{{% param version %}}/java/).

Have also a look at the [connectors](/documentation/user-guide/{{% param version %}}/core/base/connectors) section that lists
all available client and server connectors and explain how to use and configure them, and the
[integrations](/documentation/user-guide/{{% param version %}}/extensions/editions-matrix) section for
a list of all available extensions providing pluggable features such as integration with servlet containers, generation of dynamic
representations, etc. You can also post your questions and help others in our [discussions forum](https://github.com/restlet/restlet-framework-java/discussions).
