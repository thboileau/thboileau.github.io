# Introduction

As a large amount of new features were added since version 1.1 of the
Restlet Framework, major packages reorganization and API refactoring was
done on the Restlet API (including the core Resource API) and a growing
number of special Restlet editions (Java SE/EE, Google Web Toolkit, Google App Engine and Android), we decided to rename the 1.2 version into a major 2.0.

In the next sections, you will get a synthesis of the major changes done
to the Restlet Framework.
